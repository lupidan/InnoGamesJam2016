# What's the game about
Multiplayer strategy game based on a post-apocalyptic world ruled by super intelligent (and violent) monkeys.

Plan your turns, let your monkeys play out your strategy and... STOP! Your time cheating skills will let you change one of your actions.

This is a game in which it is important to anticipate the movements of your opponent.
